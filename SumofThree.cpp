/*
Monocarp has an integer n
.

He wants to represent his number as a sum of three distinct positive integers x
, y
, and z
. Additionally, Monocarp wants none of the numbers x
, y
, and z
 to be divisible by 3
.

Your task is to help Monocarp to find any valid triplet of distinct positive integers x
, y
, and z
, or report that such a triplet does not exist.

Input
The first line contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤104
) — the number of testcases.

The only line of each testcase contains a single integer n
 (1≤n≤109
).

Output
For each testcase, if there is no valid triplet x
, y
, and z
, print NO on the first line.

Otherwise, print YES on the first line. On the second line, print any valid triplet of distinct positive integers x
, y
, and z
 such that x+y+z=n
, and none of the printed numbers are divisible by 3
. If there are multiple valid triplets, you can print any of them.
